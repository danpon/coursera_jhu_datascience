### Tidying process ####

The folowing operations have been applied to the original dataset files (more details in the README.md file)

1) Merge the training and test datasets (subject, y, x) and bind them in a single dataset 
2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement	 
3) Replace the activities numeric values by labels 
   (from the file "activity_labels.txt" in the original dataset)
4) Rename the variable names to remove parenthesis, replace "-", by ".", ensure that all names are lower 
   cases and replace "t" and "f" prefixes by the more explicit "time."and "freq."
5) The original data set contained several observations for each (subject,activity)
   In the processed, tidied dataset for each (subject,activity) there's only row with average values for each variables
